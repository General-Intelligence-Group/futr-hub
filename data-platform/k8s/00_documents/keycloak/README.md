# Keycloak IDM Overview

For the most part you can refer to the official documentation of Keycloak. It is well-written from a developer and an admin view:
- Glossary https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#core-concepts-and-terms
- Authorization https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/
- Admin Guide https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/
- API Reference https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/5.0/rest-api/index.html#_version_information

Also, if you want to locally setup your own keycloak to have a playground please refer to:
- Getting started Guide https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/getting_started/

Please create an issue, or give us a hint if you think the documentation is missing a topic.
