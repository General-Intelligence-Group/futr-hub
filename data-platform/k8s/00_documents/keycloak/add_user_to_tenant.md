## Add user to a tenant

In this guide the [previously created](create_user.md) user, will be given the access to the [previously created](create_tenant.md) tenant.<br>

Tenants in this platform are represented by groups with special attributes.<br>
Therefore, in order to add a user to a tenant, the user needs to joint the group.

>**Note:** The same procedure is valid for any other tenant, you want a user to access.

A user can join a group through the user's settings page.<br>
First navigate to the user, by selecting `Users` on the left side.<br>
Afterwards you can either hit the `View all users` button or enter the user-name into the field and press `Enter`.<br>
From the list presented find the desired user and either click on user-id on the left or the `Edit` button on the right.

From the users settings page, navigate to the `Groups` tab.<br>
This tab shows two different sections: **Group Membership** which show the current groups of the user and **Available Groups** which swho groups the user may join.<br>
Select the tenant/group you want the user to join and hit the `Join` button on the right of this section.
