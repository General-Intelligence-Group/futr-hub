## Add roles to a user

In this guide the [previously created](create_user.md) user will be given the role of a data-producer for the context broker.<br>

>**Note:** The same procedure is valid for any other client or realm role, you want a user to represent.

Roles can be assigned to a user through the user's settings page.<br>
First navigate to the user, by selecting `Users` on the left side.<br>
Afterwards you can either hit the `View all users` button or enter the user-name into the field and press `Enter`.<br>
From the list presented find the desired user and either click on user-id on the left or the `Edit` button on the right.

From the users settings page, navigate to the `Role Mappings` tab.<br>
This tab shows two different sections: **Realm Roles** and **Client Roles**<br>
For this guide we want to add a client role to the user.<br>
In the Client Role section, select the client `api-access` from the drop down menu.<br>
From the list of **Available Roles** select the `dataProducer` and hit the `Add selected` button.

Now the user can request access-tokens which include these role and its inherent permissions.
